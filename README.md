# Artifitial Neural Networks @ EPFL
This repository contains the two Jupyter notebooks that were graded as homework for this course.

The first one was mandatory for everyone (mainly first steps with keras and CNNs) and for the second one, we had to choose between the reinforcement learning project (the one in this repo) or to build one chatbot with RNNs.
